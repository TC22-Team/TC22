# TC22 Website Repository

This repository contains the source code for the TC22 website ([https://tc22-team.github.io/TC22](https://tc22-team.github.io/TC22))

Editing the content of this repository will automatically affect the deployed web site. To propose chanegs, please follow the guidlines:
 - The list of committee members is maintained in [membersList.html](membersList.html).
 - To avoid duplication, common elements like the menu, header, and footer are stored in separate files ([menu.html](menu.html)) as well the [header.js](header.js) and [footer.js](footer.js) files.
 - Contributions are welcome! If you're adding a new page, consider starting from the empty page template to maintain a consistent layout and style
